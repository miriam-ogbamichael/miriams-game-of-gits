House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned continued protecting the Realm, Regent all the way until his last dying breathe when he was slayed by the daring Neighboring Knight.
